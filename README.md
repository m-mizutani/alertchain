# AlertChain

AlertChain is a simple SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) framework with [OPA](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) (Open Policy Agent).

## Motivation

Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) is a platform for automating the detection, analysis, and response to security events. To enable the automated analysis of events and rapid response in SOAR systems, automated security procedures and policies must be executed

Using OPA and Rego, a SOAR system can flexibly apply a set of user-defined policies to maintain the security of applications and systems. This makes it easier to update or change security policies and enables more accurate policy application. Additionally, the Rego language is flexible and expressive, making it easy to add or modify policies.
